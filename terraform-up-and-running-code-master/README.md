# Terraform: Up & Running Code

This repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* by 
[Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).




## IMPORTANT NOTE ON 2ND EDITION

The 2nd edition of *Terraform: Up & Running* will be available shortly! If you're reading an early copy of the new edition of the book, please head over to the [2nd-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/2nd-edition), which has all the code updated to Terraform 0.12, tons of new code for the new chapters in the book, and so on. It's a work in progress, so think of this branch as a preview of what things will look like when all the updates are finished.




## Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform). 

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the 
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book. 



## More examples

The example code in *Terraform: Up and Running* are mostly for Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is a project underway
to translate these examples to their equivalents on other cloud providers, such as Google Cloud and Azure, here:
